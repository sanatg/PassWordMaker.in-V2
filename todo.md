make multiple hashes and store them into the database and also use them as passphrase

also encrypt the username


now then start making the secret notes screen in this screen for the notes and images use the firebase storage and firebase

first when the user selects the image/doc encrypt it and then store it in the database when retrive we will get the url 
decrypt the image/doc and then give a link a button from which they can download the url.

we will not display the image or we can i have not got the idea yet


the user will only able to download the encrypted version there will be a modal provided which would allow the user to drag and drop the image and then just decrypt the whole thing
